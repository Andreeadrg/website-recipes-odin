            <h3>Description</h3>
            <i><p>I don't think there's a salad in the Romanian recipe book that is more popular than eggplant salad. 
                <br>As long as summer is long, the smell of ripe aubergines wafts through households, a sign that someone is cooking up such a delight. 
                <br>Side by side or inside tasty Romanian tomatoes, with bell peppers or simply on slices of good bread, I think summer has few more delicious things to offer.
                <br>No wonder such a beloved recipe has developed all sorts of variations. We have the simple, mayo-free eggplant salad we're going to talk about today.
                <br>But we also have it with mayonnaise. We have salad with onions and eggplant salad with garlic or even both.</p></i>

            <h2>How to prepare (Let's cook!)</h2>
            <i><p>"All tourists who cross the threshold of our country, want to eat at least once traditional sarmale. 
            <br>Their delicious taste and the secret of their preparation is very well known by our housewives, who always manage to prepare the best sarmale. 
            <br>Below we tell you, step by step, how to make the best traditional sausages according to grandma's recipe."</p></i>
        
            <ol>
                <li>Cook the eggplants for salad in direct contact with a hot surface or over a flame. 
                    <br>They can also be baked in the oven, but they won't have that great smoky taste we love. </li>
                <li>Don't forget to prick the aubergines before you put them in the oven, otherwise the steam built up inside could cause them to explode, causing unwanted accidents. 
                    <br>I bake them on a hot grill and turn them from side to side until the crumb is very soft.</li>
                <li>As they cook, place the aubergines in a sieve suspended over a dish and cover loosely with a lid or foil. 
                    <br>he water contained in the aubergines will drain into the pan and the steam will cause the skins to peel off easily.</li>
                <li>Once they are all cooked, peel the aubergines, preferably while they are hot. The easiest way to do this is to scoop out the core with a spoon.</li>
                <li>Drain the ripe and cleaned aubergines in a plastic sieve. It's important to drain the juice well, it can be bitter and astringent, adversely affecting the taste of the eggplant salad.</li>
                <li> Once well drained, chop the aubergines as finely as possible. 
                <li>Once the aubergines are cooked, chopped and cooled (at room temperature), transfer them to a bowl. Start pouring in the oil in a thin stream, like mayonnaise, while stirring continuously with a wooden spoon.</li>
                <li>As more oil is incorporated into the cooked aubergines, you will notice an increasingly creamy and lighter coloured paste forming. When do we stop? Well... when we think that's enough!
                    <br>As I was saying, we can add more or less oil as we like. The important thing is to add it gradually, in a thin thread. And don't stop stirring/mixing vigorously, because the aubergine salad can be cut, just like the mayonnaise.</li>
                <li>In the end, you get a fine, well-emulsified and fairly light-coloured paste. Season the salad with salt and pepper to taste and add the juice of ½ a lemon. </li>
                <li>So, garlic or onion in eggplant salad? This time, I just put onions, a small one, finely chopped. I mixed it well and tasted it again, I added some salt. if you put garlic or both, no harm done, the important thing is that it's to your liking.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <strong><em><p>Before serving the salad, transfer to a clean bowl, cover with foil and refrigerate for at least an hour. If it's cold, the salad becomes firmer, more consistent. You can serve it as it is or you can use it to stuff various vegetables with it (tomatoes, peppers, etc).</p></em></strong>
