            <h2>How to prepare (Let's cook!)</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Peel the cabbage from the outer leaves and the stalks and pick out the leaves in which to wrap the meat.</li>
                <li>Peel and wash the onion, then chop finely. Place in a saucepan with oil and a little water and cook until golden.</li>
                <li>Mix the fried and cooled onions in a bowl with the meat, pepper, salt and rice, which has also been browned and cooled.</li>
                <li>Take walnut-sized mixture and place it on a cabbage leaf, rolling the edges inwards.</li>
                <li>Trim the smaller cabbage leaves and chop into small pieces to form a layer for the sausage.</li>
                <li>In a tall saucepan, place the sausage and bacon on top of the chopped cabbage and top with another layer of chopped cabbage. 
                <br>Pour the broth soaked in water over them, add the bay leaves and a few peppercorns. Simmer for 2 hours. Add water from time to time to prevent sticking.</li>
                <li>When the sausages are ready, sprinkle greens on top and they are just right to eat. You can have a portion of traditional sausages with sour cream or a hot pepper.</li>
            </ol>
